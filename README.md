Project text manager

Built for a personal project. (//link//)
It's a program that simulates text being typed on screen, through the terminal. It is also highly customizable.

I initially wrote the code on replit. However, I had a hard time setting up the backup feature so I manually pasted the framework here for archive purposes.


ps: This was written in a previous verion of python 3.10 so that's why you see no case switch. I know it hurts me too.
